Your future self will thank you for it. 1SE is a home for all your memories, not just the Insta-worthy ones. Get started today with Smart Fill and create a meaningful movie of your life right away.\n\n2x winner of the “Best Use of a Mobile Camera” WEBBY Award.\nFeatured by Apple, BBC, TED, CNN, Fast Company and more!\nPublic Benefit Corporation\n\n\"For over 10 years, I’ve been recording 1 second every day, so I’ll never forget another day ever again. This project had such a positive impact on my day-to-day life after a few months, that I dedicated my life to making a mobile app which would make it easy for anyone to do this too. Being able to relive every single day has provided me with a treasured perspective on life. It holds me accountable for making each day notable. When I turned 40, I had a 1-hour movie that encapsulated my 30s. If I live to see 80 years of age, I’ll have a 5-hour video that summarizes 50 years of my life.\"\n\n- Cesar Kuriyama, 1SE Founder\n\n\nWhy 1SE is awesome:\n\n- AD FREE: 1SE is free to use without ads!\n\n- SMART-FILL: Don't know where to start?
