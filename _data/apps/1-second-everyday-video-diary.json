Crowds!\n\nTeam 1SE is delighted to announce the release of 1SE Crowds- an opt-in social experience built directly into the 1SE app. You can now share your daily snippets with those closest to you! Snippets you share to your Crowd are delivered in a finite, chronological feed only visible to those you allow to follow you. Snippets you share on Crowds expire after 72 hours, though you can keep a permanent copy for yourself by adding these snippets to your own project just as you always have. \n\nCrowds has been a long time in the making, and it’s always been part of our dream to provide users with a safe, private way to share their experiences with the people they’re close to. Crowds is completely free, and does not interfere with or replace any existing 1SE functionality - it’s our New Year’s gift to everyone.\n\nWe would love to hear any and all feedback. Please email your questions, ideas, or words of encouragement to support@1secondeveryday.com, or look for Contact Support and Request a Feature in the settings screen in the app. Happy to help.\n\nWe live and die by reviews; your reviews.

It’s a home for all your notable memories, not just the Insta-worthy. Get started with 1SE today!\n\n2x winner of the “Best Use of a Mobile Camera” WEBBY Award.\nFeatured by Apple, BBC, TED, CNN, Fast Company and more!\n\n\"For over 10 years, I’ve been recording 1 second every day, so I’ll never forget another day ever again. This project had such a positive impact on my day-to-day life after a few months, that I dedicated my life to making a mobile app which would make it easy for anyone to do this too. Being able to relive every single day has provided me with a treasured perspective on life. It holds me accountable for making each day notable. When I turned 40, I had a 1-hour movie that encapsulated my 30s. If I live to see 80 years of age, I’ll have a 5-hour video that summarizes 50 years of my life.\"\n\n- Cesar Kuriyama, 1SE Founder\n\n\nWhy 1SE is awesome:\n\n- AD FREE: 1SE is free to use without ads!\n\n- AUTO-FILL: Don't know where to start?
