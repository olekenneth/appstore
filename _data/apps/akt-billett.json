The app is valid on buses.\n\nQuick purchases options are based on your previous purchases and issue you a new ticket in just two easy stages.\n\nYou can buy a ticket just for yourself or for a group travelling together.\n\nYou can buy tickets in advance, and you can change the start time for your ticket.\n\nFor additional security, you can change the fare limit for which a password is required when buying tickets.\n\nYour receipt will be sent via e-mail.\n\nAKT Billett requests access permission to the following functions:\n\n* Location\n\nUsed in connection with ticket purchases so that AKT Billett can automatically suggest a ticket based on the zone in which you are located. You can still purchase a ticket even if the location function is turned off, but you must manually enter the stop or station from which the ticket will apply.\n\n* Contacts\n\nUsed when sending tickets to phone numbers stored in your contacts.\n\n* Notifications\n\nUsed to send notifications when tickets and payment cards expire. You can still purchase a ticket even if the notification function is turned off.\n\n* Background App Refresh\n\nUsed at night when updating your control code and today's picture so that next day you always have the valid code and picture ready for a ticket inspection. You can still purchase a ticket even if the background update function is turned off.\n\n* Mobile Data\n\nUsed when communicating with AKT during ticket purchases. If the app's access to mobile data is blocked, you can only buy a ticket if you have access to a wireless network (Wi-Fi). You must also have network access in order to display the control code and today's picture during a ticket inspection.\n\nIf you want to block access, you can do so from your phone using the \"Settings\" page.\n\nhttp://www.akt.no\n\nhttp://www.akt.no/info/kundeservice/","primaryGenreName":"Travel","primaryGenreId":6003,"trackId":1286711969,"trackName":"AKT Billett","releaseDate":"2017-10-15T23:13:50Z","bundleId":"no.akt.aktbillett","genreIds":["6003"],"trackCensoredName":"AKT Billett","trackViewUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/no/app/akt-billett/id1286711969?uo=4","contentAdvisoryRating":"4+","averageUserRating":2.31944,"currency":"NOK","minimumOsVersion":"12.4","isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true,"version":"8.5.6","wrapperType":"software","userRatingCount":144}
