the BankID app you can identify yourself, confirm payments and sign documents.\n\nThe app meets official security requirements and can be used to:\n- Log in to public services and banks\n- Sign binding documents electronically\n- Confirm online payments\n\nInstead of using the one-time password from your code device or confirm with BankID on mobile, you rather approve requests directly in the app. The BankID-app is used together with your social security number and personal password.\n\nTo get started you need to have a BankID certificate issued by a bank. At the moment only people with BankID from certain banks can activate the BankID app*. Check where your BankID is issued at bankid.no/privat.\n\n*List of banks that support the app: https://www.bankid.no/en/private/solve-my-bankid-problem/banks-with-app/","releaseDate":"2023-02-07T08:00:00Z","primaryGenreName":"Business","primaryGenreId":6000,"releaseNotes":"This version includes improvements for scanning of passport or national ID card in ID Check.\n\nPlease send us feedback if you have any ideas on how to improve the app further!","bundleId":"no.bankid.BankID","isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true,"sellerName":"BankID BankAxept AS","trackId":1663237958,"trackName":"BankID","genreIds":["6000"],"currency":"NOK","minimumOsVersion":"15.0","version":"3.2.7","wrapperType":"software","userRatingCount":152078}
