We regularly release new versions of the app and recommend that you always use the latest version. If you have questions or feedback, you can get in touch directly in the app.","artistId":1246505631,"artistName":"Sugi Group AB","genres":["Lifestyle","Shopping"],"price":0.0,"description":"Bower is a world-unique app where you can recycle all your packaging that has a barcode and get cash-back while simultaneously helping the climate.\n\nThe purpose of the app is to scan the barcodes on packaging and be rewarded for the work you do. At the same time we provide you with a clear picture of the exact amount of carbon dioxide emissions that you save and what that actually means for our climate.\n\nOur vision is a world where all packaging has a value, so it isn’t thrown away with the garbage or out in nature, but instead ends up where they should.\n\nHOW DO I RECYCLE WITH BOWER?\n\n1. Scan and sort your packaging at home.\n\n2. Find your nearest recycling station or register your own in the app.\n\n3. Go to your nearest recycling station, open your Bower-recycle bag and select \"recycle packaging\".\n\n4. Then throw all packaging in the correct container. Nice work!\n\nWHERE CAN I RECYCLE?\n\nYou can recycle at any public recycling station. If the station isn’t recorded in the app, you can add it yourself and get rewards. You can also add personal recycling stations if you have access to multi-compartment containers, environmental rooms or optibags from home.\n\nWHAT DO I GAIN FROM RECYCLING WITH BOWER?\n\n1. Cashback\n\nAt present, you can withdraw money vouchers every month. You can transfer the money vouchers to your bank account or donate to charity. You can donate the value to most organisations, which cover the development and well-being of people, animals and nature. There is certainly something in the list of organisations that your heart is a little extra passionate about.\n\n2. Coupons\n\nThe Bower-points can be redeemed for exclusive coupons. Some coupons can be used in physical stores and some can be used online. The coupons are valid for a couple of months, so you have plenty of time to use them. A coupon cannot be combined with other offers.\n\n3. Understand your personal impact on the environment\n\nYou see how much carbon dioxide you save the environment and what it actually means.\n\nWHAT PRODUCTS ARE POSSIBLE TO RECYCLE?\n\nYou can recycle all products with a barcode with the Bower app!\n\nWHO FINANCES CASH-BACK?\n\nThanks to our collaboration with over 130 brands such as Dove, Capri-sun, Hellmann's, we can offer a deposit on all packaging.\n\nWHY IS THERE A DAILY LIMIT FOR MULTIPLE SCANS OF THE SAME PACKAGING?\n\nIf you have two or more packages of the same item, you only get points for one package the same day. This is a rule because packages of the same item have the same bar code and today we cannot tell if you have several packages or scan the same package several times. If you want to get points for all packages of the same item, you can scan one per day, but the amount of carbon dioxide emissions you save on the planet is always tracked for all packages - with or without points.\n\nNOTE ON GPS SUPPORT\n\nBower depends on GPS for finding recycling stations close to you and to start the scanner which you'll use to deposit your packages. In some devices, the GPS does not work properly and Bower will not work effectively. If you have problems with the app not finding your position or the scanner isn't starting, please try to update the operating system to the most recent version. There are some devices which have consistently poor performance with no known remedies.\n\nTerms of Use: https://en.getbower.com/terms-of-use\nPrivacy Policy: https://en.getbower.com/privacy-policy\n\nCurrently, you can only use the Bower app to recycle packaging in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, UK, and Los Angeles.\n\nDo as 325,000+ users → download the Bower app and start making money from recycling today!","bundleId":"se.pantapasen.pantapasen","sellerName":"Sugi Group AB","trackId":1246505632,"trackName":"Bower: Recycle & get rewarded","releaseDate":"2019-08-20T16:53:24Z","primaryGenreName":"Lifestyle","primaryGenreId":6012,"genreIds":["6012","6024"],"isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true,"version":"2.0.49","wrapperType":"software","minimumOsVersion":"11.0","trackCensoredName":"Bower: Recycle & get rewarded","languageCodesISO2A":["DA","EN","FI","NB","NN","SV"],"fileSizeBytes":"76265472","sellerUrl":"https://www.getbower.com","formattedPrice":"Free","contentAdvisoryRating":"4+","averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":4.43065,"userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":137,"averageUserRating":4.43065,"trackViewUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/no/app/bower-recycle-get-rewarded/id1246505632?uo=4","trackContentRating":"4+","userRatingCount":137}
