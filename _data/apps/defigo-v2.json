Working in conjunction with the Defigo Intercom and Smart Readers, Defigo v2 turns the Defigo user’s smartphone into their door key and answering device for unmatched everyday convenience.  \n\nQuick Overview \n\nThe Defigo v2 app is built for convenient property access and secure visitor management. \n\nDefigo users can use Defigo v2 to access their property with just the tap of a button, eliminating the need to carry physical keys. \n\nWhen a visitor rings a user’s doorbell on the Defigo intercom, the user  receives a video call where they can see and speak to the visitor before granting them access to the property. \n\nReceiving a call\n\nDefigo v2 makes visitor management simple.  \nWhen a visitor rings the user’s doorbell button on the Defigo intercom, the user receives a call directly to their phone. The call screen states which door the call is coming from, as well as two buttons - one that lets the user decline the call and one that lets them answer the call. \n\nIf the user chooses to answer the call, they will  see a live video stream of the visitor. The user can then speak to the visitor through the phone and choose whether they want to end the call or open the door to the visitor. \n\nThe user can receive calls from visitors as well as grant access wherever they are in the world as long as they have an internet connection. \n\nFavorites \n\nFavorites is new with Defigo v2 and allows Defigo users to add their frequently used doors to the front page of their app for quick and easy access. \n\nUsers can add doors to their Favorites directly from the Favorites screen, or from the Doors page by marking their frequently used door with a star.  \n\nOnce the door has been marked as a Favorite, the home screen of Defigo v2 will show the Favorite doors above other doors to which the user has access. \n\n\nPersonalization\n\nDefigo v2 allows Defigo users to personalize their doorbell buttons (displayed on the Defigo Intercom).  \nDepending on their level of administration access, Defigo users will either be able to edit their whole unit’s doorbell button, or just their own personal doorbell button. \n\nDefigo users can personalize their name, photo and/or logo. \n\nIf the user does not want to be disturbed, or are on vacation, they can choose to hide their doorbell button. \n\nIf the Defigo user has a doorbell button for their unit, they can choose between 3 options for the visitor call preference: \n\n\nGrouped: When visitors press the group button, they will get the individual names of all the users registered in the unit. \nSequential: Users registered in the unit will be called in priority order of the Defigo user’s choice. The Defigo user can choose how long it will take before the call goes to the next user. \nParallel: All users registered in the unit will be called at the same time. When one user accepts the call it will stop calling other users.  \n\n\nKeyfobs and Access Cards \n\nAdding a keyfob or access card can be done using the Defigo v2 mobile app. \nThe user needs to be next to a Defigo Intercom or Smart Reader that they have access to when registering the keyfob or access card. \n\nIf the Defigo user selects the door they are next to while on the ‘Access Cards’ screen, they will be guided through the process of adding a keyfob or access card. \n\nDefigo v2 can also be used to deactivate a keyfob or access card, set up a PIN code for the keyfob or access card, and delete a PIN code. \n\nAll of these can be administered from the Access Cards screen. \n\n—\n\nDefigo v2 is simple to use and makes the user’s everyday life easier and more convenient. \nFor any questions, reach out to support@getdefigo.com","averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":3.19048,"userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":21,"averageUserRating":3.19048,"trackCensoredName":"Defigo v2","languageCodesISO2A":["EN"],"fileSizeBytes":"71461888","formattedPrice":"Free","contentAdvisoryRating":"4+","trackViewUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/no/app/defigo-v2/id6737546741?uo=4","trackContentRating":"4+","minimumOsVersion":"15.0","userRatingCount":21}
