https://duckduckgo.com/hiring","description":"DuckDuckGo is a free browser that provides the most comprehensive online privacy protection in one app. Unlike most popular browsers, it has powerful privacy protections by default, including our search engine that doesn’t track your history and over a dozen other built-in protections. Millions of people use DuckDuckGo as their go-to browser to protect their everyday online activities, from searching to browsing, emailing, and more.\n\nFEATURE HIGHLIGHTS\n• Search Privately by Default — DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in, so you can easily search the web without being tracked.\n\n• Escape Website Trackers Before They Load  — Automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using (e.g. sale, ads, etc.) any data from these trackers. Our cutting-edge tracker blocking technology – called 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection – goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default.\n\n• Automatically Enforce Encryption — force many sites you visit to automatically use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection, which helps shield your data from Wi-Fi snoopers and network onlookers like your Internet provider. \n\n• Enable Built-in Email Protection — Over 85% of emails sent to Duck Addresses contained trackers that can detect when you’ve opened a message, where you were when you opened it, and what device you were using. Email Protection makes it easy to block most email trackers and hide your existing address when signing up for things online, all without switching email providers.\n\n• Escape Fingerprinting — help stop companies from creating a unique identifier for you by blocking their attempts to combine specific information about your browser and device settings.\n\n• Block Tracking Cookies — prevent most 3rd-party cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site.\n\nWe also have many protections not available on most browsers including protection from link tracking, Google AMP tracking, and more.\n\nEVERYDAY PRIVACY CONTROLS\n• Tap Fire Button, Burn Data — Clear your tabs and browsing data with our Fire Button.\n\n• Signal Your Privacy Preference with Global Privacy Control (GPC) — built-into our app, GPC intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights (for example, current or future CCPA, GDPR requirements) depends on the laws in your jurisdiction.\n\nRead more about our free Tracking Protections at https://help.duckduckgo.com/privacy/web-tracking-protections/\n\nYou don't need to wait to take back your privacy. Join the millions of people using DuckDuckGo and protect many of your everyday online activities with one app. It's privacy, simplified. \n\nPrivacy Policy: https://duckduckgo.com/privacy/","price":0.0,"trackId":663592361,"trackName":"DuckDuckGo Private Browser","releaseDate":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","primaryGenreName":"Utilities","primaryGenreId":6002,"bundleId":"com.duckduckgo.mobile.ios","genreIds":["6002","6007"],"isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true,"artistId":479988139,"artistName":"DuckDuckGo, Inc.","genres":["Utilities","Productivity"],"version":"7.113.0","wrapperType":"software","userRatingCount":5551}
