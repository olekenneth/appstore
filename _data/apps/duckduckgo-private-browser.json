we believe the best way to protect your personal information from hackers, scammers, and privacy-invasive companies is to stop it from being collected at all. That's why millions of people choose DuckDuckGo over Chrome and other browsers to search and browse online. Our built-in search engine is like Google but never tracks your searches. Our browsing protections, such as ad tracker blocking and cookie blocking, help stop other companies from collecting your data. While our optional integrated AI features, Search Assist and Duck.ai, are private and never use your data to train AI. Oh, and our browser is free — we make money from privacy-respecting search ads, not by exploiting your data. Take back control of your personal information with the browser designed for data protection, not data collection.  \n\nFEATURE HIGHLIGHTS \nProtect Your Searches by Default: DuckDuckGo Search comes built-in, so you can easily search online without being tracked.  \n\nShield Your Browsing History: Our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection blocks most trackers before they load, greatly exceeding what most popular browsers offer by default.  \n\nChat Privately with AI: Duck.ai lets you have private conversations with 3rd-party AI models, anonymized by us and never used to train AI. \n\nSecure Your Email (Optional): Use Email Protection to block most email trackers and hide your existing email address with @duck.com addresses.   \n\nWatch YouTube Videos Without Targeted Ads: Duck Player protects you from targeted ads and cookies with a distraction-free interface that incorporates YouTube’s strictest privacy settings for embedded video. \n\nAutomatically Enforce Encryption: Shield your data from network and Wi-Fi snoopers by forcing many sites to use an HTTPS connection.  \n\nEscape Fingerprinting: Make it harder for companies to create a unique identifier for you by blocking attempts to combine info about your browser and device.  \n\nSync and Back Up Securely (Optional): Sync encrypted bookmarks and passwords across your devices. \n\nClear your tabs and browsing data in a flash with the Fire Button. \n\nBanish cookie pop-ups and automatically set your preferences to minimize cookies and maximize privacy. \n\nAnd many more protections not available on most browsers, even in private browsing mode, including protection from link tracking, Global Privacy Control (GPC), and more. \n\nDUCKDUCKGO SUBSCRIPTION\nSubscribers get\n\n•\tOur VPN: Secure your connection on up to 5 devices.     \n\n• \tAccess to advanced AI models in Duck.ai: Chat privately with AI models built for complex tasks.  \n\n•\tIdentity Theft Restoration: If your identity is stolen, we’ll help restore it.   \n\nDuckDuckGo Subscription Pricing & Terms   \nPayment will be charged automatically to your Apple Account until you cancel, which you can do in app settings. You have the option to provide an email address to activate your subscription on other devices, and we will only use that email address to verify your subscription.
