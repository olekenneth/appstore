The app adapts to your user behavior and shows content that is particularly relevant to you.\n\nThe app gives you an overview of:\n• Departure and arrival time, also for each line\n• Total travel time\n• Detailed information on means of transport\n• Line number and operator info for each line\n• Name and time of arrival at all stops on the journey\n\nFilters give you the flexibility to prefer or sort out transport types, according to your needs.\n\nWith the service for departures from stops, you always have an overview of your nearby travel options. Track delays in traffic with real-time updates (where this info is available).\n\nThe app is in constant development and is not a finished product. We are now selling a few tickets to public transport, but our goal is that you can plan a trip with several travel providers - and only press \"buy ticket\" once to get all you need.\n\nEntur - for public transport in Norway\n\nAccessibility statement:\nhttps://uustatus.no/nb/erklaringer/publisert/6c52628a-3d7b-4a4a-afd9-0ab27885f452","sellerUrl":"http://www.entur.org","languageCodesISO2A":["NB","NN"],"trackContentRating":"4+","averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":4.36801,"fileSizeBytes":"134223872","formattedPrice":"Free","price":0.0,"genres":["Travel","Navigation"],"artistId":1225135706,"artistName":"Entur AS","userRatingCount":2201}
