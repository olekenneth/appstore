and minor adjustments\n\nWe are constantly updating our app to make your experience even better. Remember to turn on automatic updates to make sure that you do not miss out!  \n\nWe hope you will be happy with the update! As always, we are here to help. If you come across a bug, want to provide feedback or need any help, you can reach us at support@firi.com.","genres":["Finance","Business"],"price":0.0,"trackId":1542108249,"trackName":"Firi - Buy Bitcoin & Ethereum","description":"Buy, sell and save in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a variety of other cryptocurrencies with Firi.\n\nEASY TO BUY AND SELL CRYPTO\nFiri is a Nordic cryptocurrency exchange. We offer a variety of well-known cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), Chainlink (LINK) and more. We are constantly working on adding more cryptocurrencies. Trading takes place easily and seamlessly in the app, and you also get access to advanced trading on our platform at firi.no.\n\nFIXED SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT IN CRYPTOCURRENCY\nWith our “Kryptosparing” savings agreement, you can set up a savings plan and save regularly in one or more optional cryptocurrencies. This is an excellent investment strategy for both beginners and advanced investors, because you reduce risk by spreading the purchases over a longer period. This strategy is also known as DCA, or \"Dollar Cost Averaging\". Firi gives you an exciting alternative to saving in funds and stocks.\n\nEARN EXTRA CRYPTO WITH FIRI REWARD (FIRI FORDEL) \nWith our loyalty program, “Firi Fordel”, you can earn extra crypto while trading crypto or using our app. For example, you earn 100 kroner in bitcoin for each friend you invite with your referral code. We can offer multiple rewards and contests where you can earn free cryptocurrency through our app.\n\nFiri also enables crypto staking where you can earn an interest income on your cryptocurrency. You can read more about staking in the Firi app.\n\nDONT'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR CRYPTO WALLET.\nTo make it safe and easy for you to get started with investing in crypto, we will take care of all your crypto wallets for you. Investors using Firi can rest assured that their critical digital assets are being protected by the highest level of security on the market.\n\nLOW FEES\nThe Firi app is completely free, and it is also free to deposit FIAT and cryptocurrency to Firi. When you buy and sell cryptocurrency, we charge a fee of only 0.7%, and we have low prices on withdrawals of cryptocurrency and FIAT. There are no hidden fees when you buy crypto with Firi. See our complete price list here: https://firi.com/about/transactions-and-fees\n\nTHE MARKET'S BEST SECURITY SOLUTIONS\nFiri never takes any risk with our customers' funds and we do not touch your funds unless you specifically ask us to do so.\n\nWe also secure and insure customers' funds through our partnership with Fireblocks, which is a cryptocurrency security platform. Fireblocks' wallet infrastructure is based on what is called Multiparty Computation (MPC), a cryptographic technology that allows the user to split and distribute private keys across multiple locations, so that customer funds are always protected.\n\nYour crypto cannot be hacked. We store most of the keys to the customer funds cold at all times, i.e. cold storage, which means that they are in no way accessible from the internet or in any way connected to other computers. This is also the safest way to store crypto.\n\nFOLLOW YOUR PORTFOLIOS CLOSELY\nIn the app, you can follow the development of your crypto portfolio and get an overview of the distribution between different cryptocurrencies.\n\nEASY CRYPTO TAX WITH FREE TAX CALCULATOR\nCalculating the tax on crypto investments can seem complicated. Fortunately, Firi makes this process as easy as possible with our tax calculator that calculates the tax for you. We give you the numbers you must enter in the tax return, and attach the document you must deliver to the tax authorities.  \n\nNOTE: Crypto prices change all the time. Prices shown in the screenshots here will not necessarily correspond to the current price at this time.\n\nABOUT FIRI\nIn 2019, Firi was registered with Finanstilsynet as a service provider for the exchange and storage of virtual currency in Norway. We are also registered with Finanstilsynet in Denmark.","releaseDate":"2021-01-09T08:00:00Z","isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true,"genreIds":["6015","6000"],"bundleId":"com.mirai.miraiex","primaryGenreName":"Finance","primaryGenreId":6015,"sellerName":"Firi AS","currency":"NOK","trackViewUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/no/app/firi-buy-bitcoin-ethereum/id1542108249?uo=4","contentAdvisoryRating":"4+","trackCensoredName":"Firi - Buy Bitcoin & Ethereum","averageUserRating":4.5773,"artistId":1542108251,"artistName":"Firi AS","version":"3.2.7","wrapperType":"software","userRatingCount":4916}
