Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 35,000 ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration (MLAT), we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. \n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\n\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, you can contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist.\n• Email (support@fr24.com)\n• X (@Flightradar24)\n• Facebook (@Flightradar24)\n• YouTube (@Flightradar24DotCom)\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes.
