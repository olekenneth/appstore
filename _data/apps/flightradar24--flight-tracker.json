Silver and Gold upgrade prices are listed in the app as they vary depending on your country and currency. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 50,000 ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration (MLAT), we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. \n\nCONNECT WITH US\n\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, you can contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist.\n• Email (support@fr24.com)\n• X (@Flightradar24)\n• Facebook (@Flightradar24)\n• YouTube (@Flightradar24DotCom)\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes.
