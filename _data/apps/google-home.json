Set up, manage and control your Google Nest, Wi-Fi and Chromecast devices, plus thousands of compatible smart home products like lights, cameras, thermostats and more â€“ all from the Google Home app. \n\nPersonalise your home view.\nPin your most-used devices, automations and actions to the Favourites tab for easy access the moment you open the app. View your Nest cameras and doorbell live feeds, and easily scan through event history. Set up and manage routines in the Automations tab. And quickly edit any permissions in the consolidated Settings tab. \n\nUnderstand what's going on at home at a glance.\nThe Google Home app is designed to show you the status of your home and keep you up to date with what you may have missed. Check in on your home at any time and see a recap of recent events.\n\nControl your home from anywhere. \nTurn on the lights, adjust the thermostat or get an alert when there's a person or parcel at your front door. With Google Home for Wear OS, you can control your home right from your compatible smartwatch. \n\nA helpful home is a private home.\nProtecting your privacy starts with one of the world's most advanced security infrastructures, which we build directly into Google products so that they're secure by default. And Google uses your compatible devices and data to make your home helpful, but only in the ways that you allow. Visit the Google Nest Safety Centre at safety.google/nest to learn more about how we protect your information and respect your privacy.\n\n* Some products and features may not be available in all regions. Compatible devices required.","contentAdvisoryRating":"12+","averageUserRating":4.16435,"trackCensoredName":"Google Home","trackViewUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/no/app/google-home/id680819774?uo=4","userRatingCount":20962}
