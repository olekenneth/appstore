the next few weeks, we’ll be rolling out the following:\nWith the Google Home app you can control and manage compatible lights, cameras, TVs and more – all from one place.\nNew in this update:\nBug fixes and improvements","bundleId":"com.google.Chromecast","description":"Set up, manage and control your Google Nest, Google Wifi, Google Home and Chromecast devices, plus thousands of compatible connected home products like lights, cameras, thermostats and more – all from the Google Home app.\n \nOne view of your home.\nThe Home tab gives you shortcuts for the things that you do most, such as playing music or dimming the lights when you want to start a film. Control it all with just a tap or two – and get to the good stuff faster. The Feed tab highlights important events in your home in one place. Here, you’ll also find ways to get more out of your devices and improve your home setup.\n \nCreate routines that allow you to turn on compatible lights, check the weather, play the news and more with one simple command.\n \nSee all the active audio and video streams on your compatible home devices in one place, change the volume, skip to the next track or quickly change which speakers they’re playing from.\n \nUnderstand what’s going on at home with a glance. The Google Home app is designed to show you the status of your home and keep you up to date with what you may have missed. Check in on your home at any time and see a recap of recent events. You can also get a notification if something important happens while you’re away.\n \nSet up your Nest Wifi and Google Wifi in minutes using the Google Home app. Run speed tests, set up a guest network, and easily share your Wi-Fi password with family and friends. Use parental controls like Wi-Fi pause to manage online time for the children. Automatically prioritise video conferencing and gaming traffic on all devices, or decide which devices to prioritise for all traffic types. Get more insights on your network, whether it’s a notification when a new device joins your network or detailed insights for troubleshooting a poor Internet connection.\n \nA helpful home is a private home.\nProtecting your privacy starts with one of the world’s most advanced security infrastructures, which we build directly into all Google products so that they’re secure by default. The built-in security in your Google Account automatically detects and blocks threats before they ever reach you, so that your personal information is always secure.\n \nWe build privacy tools that keep you in control.\nControl your Google Assistant activity, privacy settings, information and personal preferences. See your activity, delete it manually or choose to delete it automatically. Control your privacy on Google Assistant with your voice. Ask questions like, 'Where can I change my privacy settings?' to get answers to the most common privacy and security questions.\n \nVisit the Google Nest Safety Centre at safety.google/nest to find out more about how we protect your information and respect your privacy.\n\n* Some products and features may not be available in all regions.
