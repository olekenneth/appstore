Control it all with just a tap or two – and get to the good stuff faster. The Feed tab highlights important events in your home in one place. Here, you’ll also find ways to get more out of your devices and improve your home setup.\n \nCreate routines that allow you to turn on compatible lights, check the weather, play the news and more with one simple command.\n \nSee all the active audio and video streams on your compatible home devices in one place, change the volume, skip to the next track or quickly change which speakers they’re playing from.\n \nUnderstand what’s going on at home with a glance. The Google Home app is designed to show you the status of your home and keep you up to date with what you may have missed. Check in on your home at any time and see a recap of recent events. You can also get a notification if something important happens while you’re away.\n \nSet up your Nest Wifi and Google Wifi in minutes using the Google Home app. Run speed tests, set up a guest network, and easily share your Wi-Fi password with family and friends. Use parental controls like Wi-Fi pause to manage online time for the children.

Get more insights on your network, whether it’s a notification when a new device joins your network or detailed insights for troubleshooting a poor Internet connection.\n \nA helpful home is a private home.\nProtecting your privacy starts with one of the world’s most advanced security infrastructures, which we build directly into all Google products so that they’re secure by default. The built-in security in your Google Account automatically detects and blocks threats before they ever reach you, so that your personal information is always secure.\n \nWe build privacy tools that keep you in control.\nControl your Google Assistant activity, privacy settings, information and personal preferences. See your activity, delete it manually or choose to delete it automatically. Control your privacy on Google Assistant with your voice.
