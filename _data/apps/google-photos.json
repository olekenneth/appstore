This release includes bug fixes and performance improvements.\n\nWe fixed user-reported issues and added new features to help you do more in Google Photos.","version":"7.65.0","wrapperType":"software","currency":"NOK","description":"Google Photos is the home for all your photos and videos. Easily store, edit, organise and search your memories with the help of Google AI.\n\n\n• 15 GB OF CLOUD STORAGE: Every Google Account gets up to 15 GB of storage*, three times more than many other cloud storage services. This means you can back up your memories and keep them safe automatically on all of your devices.\n\n\n• AI-POWERED EDITING TOOLS: Make complex edits in just a few taps. Remove unwanted distractions with Magic Eraser. Improve out-of-focus, blurry photos with Unblur. Enhance lighting and brightness with Portrait Light.\n\n\n• SEARCH MADE SIMPLE: Your photos are easily searchable in a natural, descriptive way, like 'Alice and me laughing', 'Kayaking on a lake surrounded by mountains' or 'Emma painting in the back garden'.\n\n\n• EASY ORGANISATION: Google Photos helps to declutter your gallery by automatically organising duplicates and similar photos into photo stacks. It also offers smart, intuitive folders for screenshots, documents, custom albums and daily camera roll organisation, making your gallery feel orderly and personalised. You can even save sensitive photos and videos to a locked folder protected by your device screen lock.\n\n\n• RELIVE AND SHARE YOUR FAVOURITE MEMORIES: Stroll down memory lane in Google Photos. Share photos, videos and albums with any of your contacts – even if they don't use Google Photos.\n\n\n• YOUR MEMORIES ARE SAFE: Your photos and videos are safe and secure from the instant that you store them, protected by our advanced security infrastructure while in storage or when you share them.\n\n\n• ALL YOUR MEMORIES IN ONE PLACE:  With backup on, you can easily transfer your photos from other apps, galleries and devices, so all of your content is in one place.\n\n\n• FREE UP SPACE: Never worry about running out of space on your phone again. Photos that are backed up in Google Photos can be removed from your device's storage in just a tap.\n\n\n• PRINT YOUR FAVOURITE MOMENTS:\nFrom your phone to your home. Turn your favourite memories into photo books, photo prints, canvas wall art and more. Price varies by product. Printing services available in the US, EU, UK and CA only.\n\n\n• GOOGLE LENS: Search what you see. This preview enables you to identify text and objects in your photos to learn more and take action.\n\n\nGoogle Privacy Policy: https://google.com/intl/en_GB/policies/privacy\n\n\n* Google Account storage is shared across Google Photos, Gmail and Google Drive. In some countries, every account gets 5 GB of storage with the option to unlock an additional 10 GB by adding a phone number.","minimumOsVersion":"18.0","languageCodesISO2A":["AR","BN","BG","CA","HR","CS","DA","NL","EN","FI","FR","DE","EL","HE","HI","HU","ID","IT","JA","KK","KO","LT","MS","NB","FA","PL","PT","RO","RU","ZH","SK","SL","ES","SV","TH","ZH","TR","UK","VI"],"fileSizeBytes":"406811648","formattedPrice":"Free","userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":9618,"trackContentRating":"4+","sellerUrl":"https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB/photos/about","averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":4.60271,"trackCensoredName":"Google Photos: Backup & Edit","trackViewUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/no/app/google-photos-backup-edit/id962194608?uo=4","userRatingCount":9618}
