Subscriptions and auto-renewal may be managed by going to iTunes Account Settings after purchase.\n\nGoogle Privacy Policy: https://google.com/intl/en_US/policies/privacy\nGoogle One Terms of Service: https://one.google.com/terms-of-service\n\nNote: Face grouping is not available in all countries.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.
