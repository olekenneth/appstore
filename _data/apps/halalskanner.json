to Halalskanner 2.0\n\nHalalskanner 2.0 makes it even easier to find halal alternatives in Norway. We have updated the app from a simple barcode scanner to a complete guide for both food products and dining spots.\n\nHere is what you can do:\n\nAI Analysis If a product is missing from the database, the app can read the ingredient list for you.\n\nTake a photo: Scan the ingredient list directly with your camera. The app checks the text for E-numbers and additives.\nGet answers: You get an explanation of why an ingredient might be problematic, and an assessment of whether it is safe.\nTailored to Your Needs The app takes into account that Halal can be interpreted differently.\n\nChoose Law School: Set your preference in your profile (Hanafi, Shafi'i, Maliki, or Hanbali).\nAutomatic Status: The app shows you the status of products based on your selected school. If there is no specific ruling, we show the standard assessment.\nDining Spots & Restaurants Find safe places to eat.\n\nCertifications: Look for the Gold icon for places we have manually verified (alcohol-free policy, kitchen routines), or the IRN badge for places with official certification.\nOverview: Quickly see if a place is 100% Halal, serves alcohol, or has a partial halal menu.\nProfile & Community Help us make the database better.\n\nLeaderboard: See who contributes the most in the app.\nStatistics: Keep track of how many products you have scanned or submitted.\nContribute: Add new products or updates directly from your profile.\nQuality & Troubleshooting We make it clear what kind of information you are viewing.\n\nVerification: We label info as \"Verified\" (checked by humans), \"AI Checked\" (analyzed by the app), or \"Not Verified\".\nReport: Found an error? Let us know directly in the app so we can fix it.\nCoupons Save money on halal food.\n\nOffers: Find discounts at selected restaurants and stores.\nEasy Use: Show the QR code at checkout to use the coupon.\nHalalskanner 2.0 – Your everyday guide.","averageUserRating":4.65991,"trackCensoredName":"Halalskanner","trackViewUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/no/app/halalskanner/id6447130411?uo=4","contentAdvisoryRating":"4+","sellerUrl":"https://www.halalskanner.no","languageCodesISO2A":["EN","NB"],"fileSizeBytes":"15163392","formattedPrice":"Free","userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":247,"trackContentRating":"4+","minimumOsVersion":"18.0","averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":4.65991,"currentVersionReleaseDate":"2026-02-11T06:23:02Z","artistId":424499228,"artistName":"Danial Siddiq Sheikh","userRatingCount":247}
