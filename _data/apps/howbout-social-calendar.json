distractions from what really matters. \n\nYou get live updates from the people you *want* to know everything about. \n\nSo, when they add  “Cutting my own bangs lol”, you know to chat them “Is everything okay at home?” \n\nOr when they’re at “Final conversation with the ex”, you know to schedule in a ‘Post-closure debrief’. \n\nOr when they drop in “Attempting to cook that one pasta dish from TikTok”, you can hit them with a chef emoji react so they know someone believes in them (even if they burn toast on the reg).\n\nBecause your Close Friends list deserves an app made for them. Keep up with what friends are up to, see what they’re doing, and actually spend time together. \n\n…\n\nFeatured by Apple, Business Insider, BBC, MailOnline, TechCrunch and more!\n\nOver 5 million people use Howbout to get the latest updates and hottest gossip from their friends\n\n…\n\nSHARE CALENDARS\n\n- Want to stay in-the-know with what your friends are up to? Share calendars and keep up with friends’ updates to stay connected\n\nMAKE PLANS\n\n- Actually get plans out of the group chat and stop the bed rot. Unless you’re scheduling time to 'group bed rot' together…\n\nSHARE AVAILABILITY\n\n- Find when everyone’s free to meet up and give as much or as little detail as you want\n\nCHAT, CHAT, CHAT\n\n- For my yappers, there’s a built-in group chat for every plan and group, and you can slide into your friends’ DMs too\n\nGET NOTIFIED\n\n- Choose if you want to get notified for all your friends’ updates\n\nFRIENDS-ONLY ACTIVITY FEED\n\n- See all your friends' latest updates on the activity feed\n\nREACT TO FRIENDS' UPDATES\n\n- Show friends you care by reacting to everything they add and do\n\nSET WHO SEES WHAT\n\n- Choose to share any event with all friends, just Best Friends, or with no one\n\nSYNC CALENDARS\n\n- Forced to use a different calendar for work? Gross. Sync it all into Howbout\n\nSHARE PICS & VIDS\n\n- Send pictures & videos directly in events\n\nSEND INVITES\n\n- Invite anyone easily with a link\n\n…\n\nBored of stalking your friends on Howbout?
