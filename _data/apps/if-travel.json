app you can among other things:\n- Get an overview of both your personal and employerâ€™s travel insurances\n- Present your travel insurance certificate, which confirms valid travel insurance and ensures that you get the help you need abroad\n- Contact a digital doctor for medical advice\n- Locate the nearest approved doctors and hospitals for timely assistance by the right care provider\n- Quickly get in touch with us for help while traveling\n- Report a claim\n- Take a simple health check before traveling\n\nDo you have thoughts or input concerning the app? We would greatly appreciate your feedback which will help us improve the user experience!\n\nUsage of the app requires BankID authentication.\nThe app is available in both Norwegian and in English. You can use the app on devices with iOS 15 or newer.","averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":2.75,"languageCodesISO2A":["EN","NB"],"fileSizeBytes":"28401664","formattedPrice":"Free","userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":8,"trackContentRating":"12+","userRatingCount":8}
