Fitness","Sports"],"price":0.0,"genreIds":["6013","6004"],"description":"Get to know your body and take control of your lifestyle with Mia Health.\nMia Health makes good health easy by giving unique personalized insight and research-based lifestyle advice. Starting with an inspiring physical activity score, we are expanding to other health pillars, such as sleep and nutrition in the future.\n\nHow does it work?\n1. Register your activity by pairing your wearable or inputting your data manually in the Mia Health app.\n2. Get continuous insight into your health status.\n3. Take action to maintain a heart-healthy lifestyle.\n\nSo whether you are trying to get more active, understand your body better, or simply be part of a bigger community inspiring healthy habits, we got you covered. Mia Health is here to guide you through advice tailored to your individual needs and personal health profile.\n\nWhat can Mia Health do for you?\n\n1. UNDERSTAND THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR YOU\nThe Mia Health App uses AQ to measure your activity. AQ is short for Activity Quotient. You earn AQ every time your heart rate increases, no matter which type of physical activity you choose to do. Research from the Nobel Prize winning Faculty of Medicine and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) shows that those who stay at or above 100 AQ have markedly lower risk of lifestyle diseases such as a heart attack, dementia and obesity.\n\n2. GET A HEALTH STATUS BASED ON YOUR CURRENT ACTIVITY LEVEL\nThe Mia Health app can give you the status of your physical fitness by estimating your VO₂ max and fitness age.\n\nYour VO₂ max is one of the best indicators of your overall health. Mia Health estimates VO₂ max with NTNU's validated Fitness Calculator and uses artificial intelligence and AQ to update your VO₂ max over time.\n\nYour fitness age is calculated from your VO₂ max to let you know how old your body is. The lower your fitness age, the more protected you are from developing lifestyle diseases such as heart attack, depression, dementia, and several types of cancer.\n\n3. PLAN THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF ACTIVITY YOU NEED TO DO TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED HEALTH EFFECT\nThe Mia health app helps you plan your activity in terms of duration and intensity. You can decide whether to increase your activity effort, go for a moderate routine instead, or choose to have a recovery day.\n\n4. GET PERSONALIZED HEALTH PREDICTIONS\nThe Mia Health App motivates users to reach their goals by showing them their activity effort translated into fitness age and VO₂ max predictions 90 days in the future. In addition, it suggests what the future would look like if you were to improve your activity habits. The app can give you a prognosis after a few weeks of usage and learning your activity patterns.\n\nNOTES:\n\nThe Mia Health App does not provide any medical diagnosis or treatment advice. Our Terms also clearly state we are not a diagnostic tool in any way, only providing insight and understanding about physical activity and lifestyle. Please, consult with your healthcare provider before making significant changes to your exercise routine.\n\nThe Mia Health App supports data import from multiple wearables both via Health Kit and directly from Garmin, Fitbit, Suunto, Withings, and Polar.\n\nTerms of use: https://miahealth.no/terms-of-service/","trackId":1658974043,"trackName":"MIA Health","releaseDate":"2023-04-12T07:00:00Z","primaryGenreName":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"bundleId":"no.miahealth.mia","currentVersionReleaseDate":"2024-09-16T07:30:59Z","sellerName":"Mia Health AS","isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true,"minimumOsVersion":"15.0","averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":3.42953,"averageUserRating":3.42953,"trackCensoredName":"MIA Health","languageCodesISO2A":["EN"],"sellerUrl":"https://miahealth.no/","formattedPrice":"Free","contentAdvisoryRating":"4+","userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":149,"trackViewUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/no/app/mia-health/id1658974043?uo=4","trackContentRating":"4+","fileSizeBytes":"83734528","currency":"NOK","version":"2.1.0","wrapperType":"software","userRatingCount":149}
