You can switch off AQ sharing anytime.","version":"2.13.1","wrapperType":"software","currency":"NOK","description":"Mia Health – Your Health App for AQ, Training, and a Healthier Lifestyle\nMia Health makes good health easily accessible by providing you with unique, personalized insights and research-based lifestyle advice.
