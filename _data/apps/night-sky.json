This is all done magically.  Whether you’re looking for a constellation, or the International Space Station, let Night Sky direct you to it, then explore the object in AR!\n\nFEATURE SET: \n\n- NIGHT SKY + AURA (Night Sky + Aura Subscription required) - Your Personal AI Super Astronomer!  Ask Night Sky Aura virtually anything about Space and it will know the answer.  Night Sky Aura fully interfaces with features within Night Sky, to direct you to objects you’re interested in, provide information on anything to do with astronomy, or even show you how the sky looks on the other side of the world!  With your own personal AI Super Astronomer right by your side, Night Sky Aura becomes the new natural way to interact with the sky above! \n\n- SKY TAGS - Make Night Sky yours, by adding personal Sky Tags to the map!  Pin Sky Tags to objects in the sky to save for future reference, and share them via iMessage so others can find them!  Sky Tags can be categorized, and are completely personal to you.  Maybe you want to tag a star as a memorial to someone, or tag something you’d like to observe later that night.  You can even add Astrophotography photos and observation notes to your Sky Tags!  \n\n- CONNECTED STARGAZING (+ Feature) - Connected Stargazing is a revolutionary new feature that utilizes SharePlay in iOS 15.1, allowing you to stargaze with others when you are apart!  Start a FaceTime Audio call with those who you would like to stargaze with, then create a session by adding objects for everyone to find in the sky!\n\n- SPATIAL AUDIO OBJECT NAVIGATION - Using AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, search for an object when automatic sky tracking is on, and Night Sky will make the star, planet or constellation ‘chirp’ in the 360° soundscape, assisting you to navigate to the object with sound!\n\n- AR SKY WINDOW - Erase the ceiling of your bedroom, lounge or classroom with AR!  Night Sky intelligently detects the ceiling or other flat surface in a room, and can make it magically disappear to reveal the sky behind it!  \n\n- BILLIONS OF STARS!  (+ Feature) - Space is vast, so Night Sky has been hyper charged with over 1.7 BILLION STARS streamed from the cloud!  With a new super deep zoom (greater than 10X before), prepare to delve deeper into space than you ever imagined!\n\n- MAPS UI - A clean and familiar interface with Search features including Quick Find, intelligent Night Red Mode, Light Pollution indicator and easy to use menu, prepare to navigate Night Sky quicker than ever before!\n\n- AR PLANETARY PORTALS & AR GRAND ORRERY (+ Features) - Step onto the surface of other planets by placing AR portals around your room!  Or walk around the entire Solar System using the newly refreshed interactive Grand Orrery!\n\n- NIGHT SKY WATCH AR - Night Sky magically comes to life on Apple Watch, with Glass Constellations, Red Vision, and Night Sky Live Tours - all on your wrist! \n\n- AR OBJECT EXPLORATION  - Pull Planets, Stars and Constellations out of the sky and look at them in detailed AR!\n\n- NIGHT SKY TOURS (+ Feature):  Get a live sky tour or create your own sky tours for any location and time in the world!  \n\n- NIGHT SKY MINDFULNESS (+ Feature) - A mindfulness stargazing experience adding mindfulness minutes with Apple HealthKit. \n\n- AND MANY MORE FEATURES! \n\n\nSubscription Information: 'Night Sky +' and 'Night Sky + Aura' are available as optional subscriptions.
