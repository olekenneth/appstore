Begin by installing the app on your mobile device and go through the activation process. You shouldn’t rely on just one copy of the Nordea ID app. If your phone or tablet breaks down or gets lost, you will also lose the Nordea ID app and you will need to go through the activation process again. To avoid this, we recommend that you  install the Nordea ID app on more than one mobile device.\n\nWith the Nordea ID app you can:\n- log in to Nordea services and confirm actions\n- confirm online payments in a secure way\n- as a personal customer identify yourself in other service providers’ services (only in Finland and Norway)\n- identify yourself when calling Nordea Customer Service. (only in Finland and Norway)\n\nThe app can’t be used on rooted mobile devices for security reasons.\n\nRead more:\nFinland: nordea.fi/IDapp\nNorway: nordea.no/NordeaID\nDenmark: nordea.dk/NordeaID","currency":"NOK","genreIds":["6015","6000"],"bundleId":"com.nordea.mobiletoken","primaryGenreName":"Finance","primaryGenreId":6015,"trackId":995971128,"trackName":"Nordea ID","releaseDate":"2015-06-22T14:48:03Z","sellerName":"Nordea Bank AB","isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true,"averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":4.14925,"averageUserRating":4.14925,"trackCensoredName":"Nordea ID","languageCodesISO2A":["DA","EN","FI","NB","SV"],"fileSizeBytes":"34652160","sellerUrl":"http://nordea.fi/IDapp","formattedPrice":"Free","contentAdvisoryRating":"4+","userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":29386,"trackViewUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/no/app/nordea-id/id995971128?uo=4","trackContentRating":"4+","minimumOsVersion":"15.0","version":"2.6.0","wrapperType":"software","userRatingCount":29386}
