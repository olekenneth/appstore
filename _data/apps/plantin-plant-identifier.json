learn how to identify a plant, how often to water your trees, or why the leaf on your flower turned brown.\n\nWe have a wide variety of features that every green thumb would fall in love with: \n\n► Watering Calculator\n\nThis feature will help to figure out the right amount of water your green pet needs. You just need to answer several questions regarding your plant’s conditions, and voila! \n\n► Light Meter\n\nHere is another helpful tool that calculates the correct lighting level for your greens! Just click the Light Meter button and point the camera at the plant. Our AR-based technology will automatically scan the nearest environment, measure the amount of light, and tell if you need to move the plant to a brighter or shadier spot. \n\n► Care Plans\n\nPlantkeeping will become even more effortless with our Personalized Care Plans. Request a plan for almost any species, from common houseplants to exotic cultivars. Your Snake plant care needs some improvements, or maybe you just got your first air plant and are not sure what to do with it? Get thorough watering, fertilization, lighting, and even pruning instructions easily and make ‘em grow!\n\n► Care Notifications\n\nOur users say that our plant care app helps with organizing daily routines! Keep calm – we will send your reminders to make sure that all your green pets are following their watering and fertilization schedules. Moreover, there are special weather notifications so that you will be warned in case of storms, freezing temperatures, and other unfavorable conditions that may harm your outdoor oasis.\n \n► Ask the Botanist\n\nUse this feature to get a consultation with our experienced gardening experts. Ask any questions regarding houseplant care and get custom recommendations, step-by-step guides, useful hints, and detailed instructions for your particular case.\n\nLast but not least, we are happy to present our latest update: \n\n► Mushroom Identification\n\nOur fresh mushroom identifier will become a fav feature for every single shroom hunter! While designed to identify fungi online in several taps, we have implemented a technology for offline id: no more hesitation while outdoors in lush woods. Identify edible mushrooms for delicious dinners, learn new fungi species, and use our feature to detect poisonous specimens.\n\nPlantIn was created to provide loving care for each of your green pets, so let’s make this world greener and educate ourselves on botany together! Stay plantuned for more lifesaving info from our plant care app.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://legal.myplantin.com/vortemol/privacy_policy.html\nTerms of Use: https://legal.myplantin.com/vortemol/terms_and_conditions.html","minimumOsVersion":"15.0","averageUserRating":4.36534,"userRatingCount":1229}
