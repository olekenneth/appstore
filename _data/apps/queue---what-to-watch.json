Keeping track of shows has never been easier. \n\nWant to rate something but don't want it to show up at the top of your Queue? Tap the new \"Archive\" button while reviewing and it'll be hidden from the social feed and go to the bottom of your Queue. Great for rating your hidden guilty pleasures or things you saw a long time ago. \n\nIn honor of version 4.2.0 we added a new Easter Egg badge on theme with our release version. Let's see if you can find it...\n\nWe gave our \"Share\" flow a much needed makeover.

And the problem is only getting worse. On Queue you can look up any movie or show, see where it’s streaming, and start binging! For your TV shows, track your progress to see how many episodes and seasons you have left. You can also keep track of everything you’ve watched and everything your friends recommend. Now you can finally get rid of that unorganized list of what to watch you've been holding onto for years. Copy and Paste any list from your Notes, docs, or spreadsheets and in just a few seconds immediately add it to your Queue.\n\nFollow your closest friends and see what they’re watching, unlock fun badges (shh, some of them are a secret), check out the Top 10 trending titles on your favorite services, and use our social sharing features to tell your friends about what you’re adding to your Queue.\n\nKeep in mind we aren't a streaming service - you still need to have access to streaming services in order to watch the movies and shows you discover on Queue.\n\nReal recommendations from real friends.\n\nWe’d love to hear from you!
