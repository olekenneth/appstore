Beyond exclusive content straight from the source, you'll also find gaming communities, insightful bloggers, passionate TV fandoms, sports enthusiasts, support groups, AI forums, the latest in celeb news, and creators of all types.\n\nIf you’re into gaming and sport, you can discover the best Xbox and PS5 forums, talk Zelda, Call Of Duty, or minecraft strategy while discussing the latest Football news, Cricket matches, and Rugby games.\n\nReddit has over 100,000 online communities (forums where members post and comment) dedicated to discussing topics. Some of the most popular global communities are:\n■ r/AskReddit, where users can ask and answer questions\n■ r/funny, which is full of humorous content, jokes, hilarious memes\n■ r/science, for scientific talks and daily news from the scientific community\n■ r/gifs, with funny animated gifs for your fun  and viewing pleasure\n■ r/music, r/fredagain, r/beyonce and other music forums where music fans gather to discuss their favourite artists and genres.\n\nOn Reddit you’ll find:\n■ Thousands of community groups and interesting topics, and a wealth of original content. \nLatest news, entertainment news, social media news, book clubs, TV fan theories, technology forums, open AI discussions, conspiracy theories, gaming forums,debate forums, and personalised content, there's a community for everyone.\n\n■ Loads of laughs\nFind popular memes, witty humour, jokes and gags, oddly satisfying videos, comedy clips, funny cat videos, and more to help you lose track of time.\n\n■ Pop culture buzz\nExplore the latest trends at r/popculturechat and r/fauxmoi, or join the lively discussions at TV groups like r/loveislandtv, r/bigbrotheruk, and r/MAFS_UK.\n\n■ AMAs, or \"Ask Me Anything\"\nCelebrities, politicians, and experts answer questions from users.\n\n■ The best discussions on any topic\nReddit’s discussion threads are where community members jump in with humour and insights for top conversations about anything; science discoveries, pop culture, gardening, entertainment, or financial advice.\n\n■ Post anonymously and get answers to all of your questions\nAsk communities anything you want. Ask questions on relationships, mental health, parenting, career advice, fitness plans, and more.\n\n■ Anonymous profiles\nConnect with people about any topic, join interactive community groups, and chat with other redditors, all anonymously.\n\nVoting and Karma:\n\nInstead of likes and hearts, Reddit’s social media network runs on upvotes or downvotes. Voting on posts and comments increase or decrease the creator’s karma, and helps popular and relevant posts rise to the top, while filtering out low-quality or irrelevant posts.\n\nWhile karma doesn't directly impact your ability to use Reddit, more karma can increase posts’ visibility and help you get noticed. Some communities require karma to post or comment, which helps maintain content quality and community standards.\n\n\n\nReddit Premium:\n\nPurchase Reddit Premium to enjoy an ads-free experience and access to premium avatar gear, r/lounge, custom app icons, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged on a recurring monthly or annual basis to your Apple account. Your monthly or annual Premium subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before your subscription ends. Cancel anytime in your device’s Account Settings. No partial refunds.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy\nUser Agreement: https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement\nReddit Rules: https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy\n\nIf you have any problems with the app, get support at RedditHelp.com","averageUserRating":4.64571,"minimumOsVersion":"15.0","trackCensoredName":"Reddit","trackViewUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/no/app/reddit/id1064216828?uo=4","contentAdvisoryRating":"17+","artistId":808295587,"artistName":"reddit","genres":["News","Social Networking"],"price":0.0,"userRatingCount":23464}
