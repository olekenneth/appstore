You’ll find gaming communities, bloggers, fandoms, sports enthusiasts, support groups, AI forums, royal news junkies, artists, and creators of all types.\n\nIf you’re into gaming and sport, you can discover the best Xbox and PS5 deals, talk Zelda or minecraft strategy while discussing the latest Football, Cricket, and Rugby matches.\n\nReddit has over 100,000 online communities (forums where members post and comment) dedicated to specific topics. Some of the most popular global communities are:\n• r/AskReddit, where users can ask and answer questions\n• r/funny, which is full of humorous content\n• r/science, for scientific discussions and real news\n• r/gifs, with funny animated gifs for your viewing pleasure\n\nOn Reddit you’ll find:\n• Thousands of community groups and interesting topics\nBreaking news, social media trends, book clubs, TV fan theories, open AI discussions, debate forums, and personalised content, there's a community for everyone.\n\n• Loads of laughs\nFind hilarious memes, oddly satisfying videos, funny cat videos, and more to help you lose track of time\n\n• AMAs, or \"Ask Me Anything\"\nCelebrities, politicians, and experts answer questions from users.\n\n• The best discussions on any topic\nReddit’s discussion threads are where community members and bloggers jump in with humour and insights for just about anything; science discoveries, pop culture, gardening, entertainment, or financial advice.\n\n• Post anonymously and get answers to all of your questions \nAsk communities anything you want. Ask questions on relationships, mental health, parenting, career help, fitness plans, and more.\n\n• Anonymous profiles so you can do YOU\nConnect with people about any topic, join interactive community groups, and chat with other redditors, all anonymously.\n\nVoting and Karma:\n\nInstead of likes and hearts, Reddit’s social media network runs on upvotes or downvotes. Voting on posts and comments increase or decrease the creator’s karma, and helps popular and relevant posts rise to the top, while filtering out low-quality or irrelevant posts.\n\nWhile karma doesn't directly impact your ability to use Reddit, more karma can increase posts’ visibility and help you get noticed. Some communities require karma to post or comment, which helps prevent sp2am or low-quality content.\n\nReddit Premium:\n\nPurchase Reddit Premium to enjoy an ads-free experience and access to premium avatar gear, r/lounge, custom app icons, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged on a recurring monthly or annual basis to your Apple account. Your monthly or annual Premium subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before your subscription ends. Cancel anytime in your device’s Account Settings. No partial refunds.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy  \nUser Agreement: https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement  \nContent Policy: https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy \n\nIf you have any problems with the app, get support at RedditHelp.com","isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true,"bundleId":"com.reddit.Reddit","sellerName":"REDDIT, INC.","genreIds":["6009","6005"],"currentVersionReleaseDate":"2023-12-12T19:31:12Z","releaseDate":"2016-05-18T06:01:47Z","trackId":1064216828,"trackName":"Reddit","primaryGenreName":"News","primaryGenreId":6009,"minimumOsVersion":"14.0","trackViewUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/no/app/reddit/id1064216828?uo=4","trackCensoredName":"Reddit","languageCodesISO2A":["EN","FR","DE","IT","PT","ES"],"fileSizeBytes":"257079296","sellerUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/mobile/download","formattedPrice":"Free","contentAdvisoryRating":"17+","averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":4.67336,"userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":21813,"averageUserRating":4.67336,"trackContentRating":"17+","version":"2023.50.0","wrapperType":"software","userRatingCount":21813}
