The ticket is valid on the Metro, buses, trams, ferries and trains in Oslo and Akershus.\n\nQuick purchases options are based on your previous purchases and issue you a new ticket in just two easy stages.\n\nYou can buy a ticket just for yourself or for a group travelling together.\n\nYou can buy tickets in advance, and you can change the start time for your ticket.\n\nFor additional security, you can change the fare limit for which a password is required when buying tickets.\n\nYour receipt will be sent via e-mail.\n\nRuterBillett requests access permission to the following functions: \n\n* Location/tracking:\nUsed in connection with ticket purchases so that RuterBillett can automatically suggest a ticket based on the zone in which you are located. You can still purchase a ticket even if the location function is turned off, but you must manually enter the stop or station from which the ticket will apply.\n\n*Notifications:\nA push notification is used during ticket transfer in order to update a ticket's status. You can still purchase a ticket even if the notification function is turned off.\n\n*Background updates:\nUsed at night when updating your control code and today's picture so that next day you always have the valid code and picture ready for a ticket inspection. You can still purchase a ticket even if the background update function is turned off.\n\n*Use of mobile data:\nUsed when communicating with Ruter's systems during ticket purchases. If the app's access to mobile data is blocked, you can only buy a ticket if you have access to a wireless network (Wi-Fi). You must also have network access in order to display the control code and today's picture during a ticket inspection.\n\nIf you want to block access, you can do so from your phone on RuterBillett's \"Settings\" page.\n\n\nwww.ruter.no\n\nwww.ruter.no/kontakt","genreIds":["6003"],"releaseDate":"2012-12-15T23:10:16Z","bundleId":"no.ruter.RuterBillett","primaryGenreName":"Travel","primaryGenreId":6003,"isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true,"sellerName":"Ruter AS","releaseNotes":"Bug fixes and improvements","currentVersionReleaseDate":"2022-12-02T08:16:10Z","minimumOsVersion":"9.0","trackCensoredName":"RuterBillett","languageCodesISO2A":["DA","EN","NB","SV"],"fileSizeBytes":"67694592","sellerUrl":"http://ruter.no/","formattedPrice":"Free","averageUserRating":2.44745,"contentAdvisoryRating":"4+","averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":2.44745,"userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":923,"trackViewUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/no/app/ruterbillett/id581486486?uo=4","trackContentRating":"4+","version":"6.14.9","wrapperType":"software","trackId":581486486,"trackName":"RuterBillett","userRatingCount":923}
