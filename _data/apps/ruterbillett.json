The ticket is valid on the Metro, buses, trams, ferries and trains in Oslo and Akershus.\n\nQuick purchases options are based on your previous purchases and issue you a new ticket in just two easy stages.\n\nYou can buy a ticket just for yourself or for a group travelling together.\n\nYou can buy tickets in advance, and you can change the start time for your ticket.\n\nFor additional security, you can change the fare limit for which a password is required when buying tickets.\n\nYour receipt will be sent via e-mail.\n\nRuterBillett requests access permission to the following functions: \n\n* Location/tracking:\nUsed in connection with ticket purchases so that RuterBillett can automatically suggest a ticket based on the zone in which you are located. You can still purchase a ticket even if the location function is turned off, but you must manually enter the stop or station from which the ticket will apply.\n\n*Notifications:\nA push notification is used during ticket transfer in order to update a ticket's status. You can still purchase a ticket even if the notification function is turned off.\n\n*Background updates:\nUsed at night when updating your control code and today's picture so that next day you always have the valid code and picture ready for a ticket inspection. You can still purchase a ticket even if the background update function is turned off.\n\n*Use of mobile data:\nUsed when communicating with Ruter's systems during ticket purchases. If the app's access to mobile data is blocked, you can only buy a ticket if you have access to a wireless network (Wi-Fi). You must also have network access in order to display the control code and today's picture during a ticket inspection.\n\nIf you want to block access, you can do so from your phone on RuterBillett's \"Settings\" page.\n\n\nwww.ruter.no\n\nwww.ruter.no/kontakt","artistId":581486549,"artistName":"Ruter As","genres":["Travel"],"price":0.0,"trackName":"RuterBillett","bundleId":"no.ruter.RuterBillett","averageUserRating":2.5,"userRatingCount":792}
