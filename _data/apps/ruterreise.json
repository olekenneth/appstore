have fixed a few bugs and made a couple of technical improvements, which should make the app a little bit better. This is the last version of the app that supports iOS 14. The app will still work a while if you have iOS 14, but we recommend that you update. Not only do you get access to new functions like widgets and other smart functions that we'll add in the app, but your phone will also become more secure.\n\nThank you for using the app and giving us feedback!
