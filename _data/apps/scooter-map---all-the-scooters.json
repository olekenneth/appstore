If the Likelihood Score is low, skip that scooter and move on to the next one.\n\nDon’t waste your time hunting after ghosts.\n\n*Powerful Filters*\nFilter by time of last GPS ping, time of last trip, company, battery percentage, and more.\n\n*Push Notifications for Nearby Scooters*\nReceive push notifications when a scooter is nearby and ready to charge. Don't worry about constantly checking multiple apps. \n\nYou can track multiple locations. So you can get a notification when a scooter shows up near your home or near your work. \n\n*Optimal Routing*\nWhen there are many scooters on the map, you want to make sure that you are going to the area that will make you the most money. Our proprietary algorithm generates a route for you to make sure you are making the most money on your way out and on your way home.\n\n*Track Your Earnings*\nImport your payments from all of the companies you charge for - Bird, Lime, Voi and more coming soon. See how you are doing over time and how you compare to other chargers.\n\nWe also publish guides to help you save money on taxes.\n\n*View GPS History of a Scooter*\nAs you may know by now, GPS is often very inaccurate. So just because a scooter says it’s in one place, it might be somewhere else. We store the scooter’s GPS history so you can figure out other places it might be. This will also give you a heads up if the scooter is in a car and moving.\n\n*Check Out Street View*\nIs a scooter behind a fence or in a warehouse area? You might not want to waste your time looking for it. \n\nScooter Map let’s you check out street view to see where you are picking up scooters before you step into your car. \n\n*See When Other Chargers Report Issues*\nYou can mark scooters missing in Scooter Map. But even better, you can see when other chargers have marked scooters missing.\n\nEasily see areas where lots of scooters are missing. Those areas likely are black holes for scooters -- they could be stolen, hoarded or just in an area with bad GPS.\n\n*Tips and Tricks*\nLearn from the best on how to optimize your earnings per hour.\n\nOur blog, newsletter and forum will keep you up to date with all the latest news about scooters and charging. \n\nSUPER CHARGER PROGRAM\n\nBecome a Super Charger to make even more money charging. The Super Charger program gives you even more powerful tools you need to spend your time wisely. \n\nStart with a free 7-day trial and then continue at only $9.99 / month. \n\nYou can subscribe and pay through your iTunes account.
