This way we can all take better care of those we surround us with.  \n\nYou cannot see who or how many people you have been in proximity to, and they cannot see you. \n\nIf you share that you have been infected, other users cannot see your identity. \n\nThe app does not register data about your location. \n\nSmittestopp is developed by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Read more about the app on www.helsenorge.no/en/smittestopp.\n\nIf you experience a problem, that you believe the developers of the app should be aware of, you can report it as an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/Fhi.Smittestopp.App/issues","version":"3.4","wrapperType":"software","userRatingCount":560}
