We house your entire active journey in one spot – and you get to share it with friends. Here’s how:\n\n• Record everything – runs, rides, hikes, yoga and over 30 other sport types. Think of Strava as the home of your movement.\n\n• Discover anywhere – our Routes tool uses de-identified Strava data to intelligently recommend popular routes based on your preferences. You can also build your own.\n\n• Build a support network – Strava’s about celebrating movement. Here you’ll find your community and cheer each other on.\n\n• Train smarter – get data insights to understand your progress and see how you improve. Your Training Log is the record of all your workouts.\n\n• Move safer – share your real-time location with loved ones while outdoors for an extra layer of safety.\n\n• Sync your favourite apps and devices – Strava is compatible with thousands of them (Apple Watch, Fitbit, Garmin – you name it).\n\n• Join and create challenges – join millions in monthly challenges to chase new goals, collect digital badges and stay accountable.\n\n• Embrace the unfiltered – your feed on Strava is filled with real efforts from real people. That’s how we motivate each other.\n\n• Whether you’re a world-class athlete or a total beginner, you belong here. Just record and go.\n\nStrava includes both a free version and a subscription version with premium features.\nStrava uses HealthKit to export your Strava activities into the Health app and to read heart rate and biometric data.\n\nYou can subscribe and pay on the App Store, using your Apple ID. Payment will be charged to your Apple ID at confirmation of purchase. Your subscription will automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renew may be turned off after purchase by going to the ‘Manage Subscription’ page in settings. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable. The subscription will renew at the same cost.\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.strava.com/legal/terms\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.strava.com/legal/privacy","isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true,"bundleId":"com.strava.stravaride","genreIds":["6013","6004"],"primaryGenreName":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"currentVersionReleaseDate":"2024-07-10T17:26:30Z","trackId":426826309,"trackName":"Strava: Run, Bike, Hike","sellerName":"Strava Inc.","trackCensoredName":"Strava: Run, Bike, Hike","languageCodesISO2A":["NL","EN","FR","DE","IT","JA","PT","RU","ZH","ES","ZH"],"fileSizeBytes":"250722304","sellerUrl":"https://www.strava.com/how-it-works","formattedPrice":"Free","contentAdvisoryRating":"4+","userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":9218,"trackViewUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/no/app/strava-run-bike-hike/id426826309?uo=4","trackContentRating":"4+","averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":4.72196,"averageUserRating":4.72196,"currency":"NOK","version":"367.0.0","wrapperType":"software","releaseDate":"2011-03-24T02:04:17Z","userRatingCount":9218}
