answers and tips from REAL PEOPLE in seconds!\n\nSuperfy lets you talk with people and get the advice you need. You can ask anything, answer others, and help them too.\nInstead of asking Siri, or going through Google search results, asking in online groups and sites like Reddit, Quora, and AMA websites for answers and tips or even searching Yelp for recommendations, just ask any question, and Superfy will instantly find people that can answer.\n\nIt's just like chatting on iMessage, but instead of asking people you know if they might have an answer, you can get to anyone who knows the answer.\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n1. Ask any question or search anything\n2. Superfy sends it to the most relevant people \n3. Get answers in instant messages from real people!\n4. Chat to find out more and talk about your interests.\n\nYou can use Superfy to ask and answer questions on literally ANYTHING.\nSuperfy will help you satisfy your curiosity and also let you help others. You will also meet new people from around the world. It's awesome!\n\nTrending questions:\n*Best thing to watch on Netflix right now? \n*Which college or university should I go to?\n*What’s it like to work at Google? \n*How do I stop dying in Fortnite?  \n*Which broadway show should I see?\n*What's the best Italian restaurant in NYC? \n*Will there be another MCU Avengers movie??\n*Going to SXSW this year - any tips?\n\nGet tips from real people about real experiences. \nChat with people who know what they are talking about!  \nIt's great if you are a curious person that has a lot of questions, and also if you are an expert in many fields and want to share your knowledge and help others.\n\n-------------------\nWe all use Google to search for stuff, and it's great! But there are many things that Google can't find because the information and tips you need are stuck in people's minds. That's why people ask Questions on their Facebook wall or Facebook Groups, ask Siri, Alexa and Cortana, or even go to chat apps like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and other apps looking for answers from people. People also use Quora, Reddit, Ask.com, and Yahoo Answers to get answers from people - these are great tools, but it's nothing like getting a response in a live chat from a real person!\n\nSuperfy is really awesome. Our users love the app because they get to help others, get answers, chat about fields of interest, and also get to meet new people from around the world and even make new friends.\n\nSuperfy is not an online group - you get your answer in a one on one chat with a real person in real-time. \n\nWe love our community; feedback is welcome at feedback@superfy.co\n\nSee you on Superfy!","artistId":1185312029,"artistName":"Superfy Technologies Ltd.","genres":["Social Networking","Entertainment"],"price":0.0,"releaseDate":"2017-11-28T19:00:10Z","userRatingCount":226}
