Whatever it is you’re interested in, you can follow and connect directly with your favorite creators and others who love the same things — or build a loyal following of your own to share your ideas, opinions and creativity with the world.\n\nA few things you can do on Threads…\n\n■ Access your Instagram followers\nYour Instagram username and verification badge are reserved for you. Automatically follow the same accounts you follow on Instagram in a few taps, and discover new accounts too.\n\n■ Share your point of view\nSpin up a new thread to express what's on your mind. This is your space to be yourself, and you control who can reply.\n\n■ Connect with friends and your favorite creators\nJump to the replies to get in on the action and react to commentary, humor and insight from the creators you know and love. Find your community and connect with people who care about whatever it is you’re interested in.\n\n■ Control the conversation\nCustomize your settings and use controls to manage who can see your content, reply to your threads, or mention you. Accounts you’ve blocked will carry over from Instagram, and we’re enforcing the same Community Guidelines to help ensure everyone interacts safely and authentically. \n\n■ Find ideas and inspiration\nFrom TV recommendations to career advice, get answers to your questions or learn something new from crowd-sourced conversations, thought leaders and industry experts.\n\n■ Never miss a moment\nStay on top of the latest trends and live events. Whether it’s about new music, movie premieres, sports, games, TV shows, fashion, or the latest product releases, find discussions and receive notifications any time your favorite profiles start a new thread.\n\n■ Open social networking – coming soon\nIn the future, there will be ways to discover more content and reach wider audiences: we are planning features that allow you to search for, follow and interact with users on open, interoperable social networks that we believe can shape the future of the internet.\n\nMeta Terms: https://www.facebook.com/terms.php\nMeta Privacy Policy: https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy\nThreads Supplemental Privacy Policy: https://help.instagram.com/515230437301944\nThreads Supplemental Terms: https://help.instagram.com/769983657850450\nInstagram Community Guidelines: https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119","genreIds":["6005","6016"],"sellerName":"Instagram, Inc.","releaseDate":"2023-12-14T08:00:00Z","bundleId":"com.burbn.barcelona","trackId":6446901002,"trackName":"Threads, an Instagram app","isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true,"minimumOsVersion":"15.0","averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":4.61346,"averageUserRating":4.61346,"formattedPrice":"Free","currency":"NOK","userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":639,"trackViewUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/no/app/threads-an-instagram-app/id6446901002?uo=4","trackContentRating":"12+","trackCensoredName":"Threads, an Instagram app","languageCodesISO2A":["HR","CS","DA","NL","EN","FI","FR","DE","EL","HI","HU","ID","IT","JA","KO","MS","NB","PL","PT","RO","RU","ZH","SK","ES","SV","TL","TH","ZH","TR","UK","VI"],"fileSizeBytes":"127045632","contentAdvisoryRating":"12+","version":"323.0","wrapperType":"software","userRatingCount":639}
