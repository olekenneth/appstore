That means you’ll always have an idea of what you’ll pay before requesting your trip.\n\nYOUR SAFETY DRIVES US\nWe’re committed to making every trip with Uber as safe as possible. That's why – in addition to our Door-to-Door Safety Standard – we've built new safety features and updated our Community Guidelines for respectful and positive experiences.\n\nYou can share your trip\nGive your loved ones peace of mind while you’re on a trip – you can share your location and trip status so they know you’ve made it to your destination.\n\nYou can contact emergency services\nYou can call the emergency services directly from the app, and your location and trip details will be displayed so you can share them quickly with emergency services.\n\nTIP AND RATE YOUR DRIVER\nAfter every trip, you can submit a rating along with comments.
