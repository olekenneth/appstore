You can also add the UV Index to your Home Screen using the accompanying widgets, set notifications for when the UV Radiation exceeds certain levels, and automatically add the UV levels to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe app will instantly show the current UV Index (UVI) at your location in an intuitive way.

Choose between 7 different home screen widgets, and add them to either you Home Screen or the Today screen.\n\nNotifications:\nThe app can notify you when the UV Index goes above a certain level. Set the desired UV Index you wish to be notified about, and you will receive a notification if the UV Index at your location goes over this treshold. The app can also notify you when you are at high risk of a sunburn, and remind you to reapply your sunscreen.\n\nApple Health app:\nThe app will automatically store the hourly UV Index for your location in the Apple Health app. Open the Apple Health app to view your UV Exposure history.\n\nApple Watch:\nYou can now check the UV Index on your watch. Tap and hold to view todays peak UVI, just as in the iOS app. The watch app also contains a My Skin section and 4 day hourly forecast.
