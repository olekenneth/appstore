driver easy access to information about what is going on along the roads where you are driving. You can see information along a route, a particular road section, or in an area you trace on the map. The app contains a mapping solution from the Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA).\n\nYou can use the app for this:\n• See traffic information in the map regarding\n     •  closed roads\n     •  roadworks\n     •  important incidents\n     • cameras and weather data\n     • rest areas\n     • ferries \n     • height restrictions\n• Quickly access traffic information by saving specific types as favourites \n• Turn on notifications for\n      • routes\n      • areas you trace in the map\n      • selected mountain passes\n      • selected weather-exposed roads\n      • selected bridges\n      • selected tunnels\n• Retrieve information about incidents in an inbox\n• See queues and driving conditions through cameras\n• See forecasts regarding closure of mountain passes and weather-exposed roads\n• Select a vehicle type and get information tailored to this type\n\nOne of the most important tasks of the traffic app from the NPRA is to provide useful information for you who are a heavy vehicle driver. As a heavy vehicle driver, you can use the app to\n• see customised height restrictions in the map\n• find relevant axle load restrictions\n• find legal routes for your vehicle based on road use category, length and height\n• find 24-h rest stops, with real-time data on vacancies\n\nAccessibility statement:\n\nIn accordance with Norwegian legislation, the NPRA has prepared an accessibility statement for the app (Norwegian only): \n• Norwegian Bokmål:https://uustatus.no/nb/erklaringer/publisert/d419077b-1755-4e7c-b71e-8150cdb3519c\n• Norwegian Nynorsk: https://uustatus.no/nn/erklaringer/publisert/d419077b-1755-4e7c-b71e-8150cdb3519c \n\nIf you wish to give us feedback regarding information or functions that are not available to you due to a lack of universal design, you can send an email to trafikkapp@vegvesen.no.","genreIds":["6002","6010"],"bundleId":"no.vegvesen.trafikk","artistId":508774020,"artistName":"Statens vegvesen","userRatingCount":100}
