So make sure you have automatic updates turned on to stay up-to-date!\n\nImprovements in this version include:\n- Usability improvements and bug fixes\n\nUntil next time, have a good one!","artistId":1395921015,"artistName":"VOI Technology AB","genres":["Travel"],"price":0.0,"description":"Rent an e-scooter or e-bike with just a tap on your phone, and get anywhere in the city within minutes. Simply download the free Voi app, create an account and get rolling!\n\nA NEW WAY TO MOVE AROUND\nVoi provides a new level of mobility to urban dwellers who want to move around freely and conveniently without compromising the environment. So swap the tube, bus or car (and skip the hassle of parking!) for a shared electric scooter or e-bike and zip around the city in style, while leaving no carbon footprint. Rolling along the streets on an e-scooter or e-bike is the perfect way to explore a new city, or simply experience your own hometown from a different perspective.\n\nGET ROLLING IN NO TIME:\n1. Get the free Voi app and create an account.\n2. Find an e-scooter or e-bike nearby using the in-app map.\n3. Unlock the vehicle by scanning the QR code on the handlebar.\n4. Set off on the e-scooter or e-bike and get to your destination in no time.\n\nE-SCOOTER OR E-BIKE?\nThe Voi electric scooter is an excellent choice for when you need to quickly get somewhere within a somewhat shorter distance, while the e-bike is ideal for longer routes.\n\nPRICING AND PASSES\nRide more for less with a monthly subscription, get a day pass or simply pay as you go. Prices vary depending on the city – check the Voi app for the exact prices that apply in your area.\n\nAROUND THE CORNER, ACROSS THE CONTINENT\nSoar along the streets of Europe! Voi lets you explore 100+ towns and cities around the continent, by two wheels. Check to see if there’s an e-scooter or e-bike available where you are – go to cities.voi.com/city.\n\nROAD SAFETY STARTS WITH YOU\nRoad safety is everyone’s responsibility. The choices you make while riding an electric scooter or e-bike affect not only you, but all your fellow road users, as well. So let’s get it right!\n\nBe sure to know the rules of the road before setting off on an e-scooter or e-bike. Stick to the bike lanes or close to the side curb, and stay off pavements. Never ride under the influence, and always wear a helmet to keep your head safe. Oh, and no twin-riding – one person per e-scooter or e-bike at a time.\n\nFIRST TIME ON AN E-SCOOTER?\nIf you haven’t used an electric scooter before – activate reduced-speed mode in the app. This caps the max speed of the scooter, allowing you to start off slow while learning to operate the vehicle.\n\nE-SCOOTER AND E-BIKE PARKING – WHAT APPLIES?\nProper parking is a matter of safety and accessibility. Keep yourself informed of your local rules and regulations in regards to e-scooter and e-bike parking – and follow them. Always park the vehicle standing upright, using the kickstand and be sure not to obstruct the path of pedestrians, cyclists or other vehicles.\n\nLEARN AND EARN\nRideSafe Academy provides micro courses that teach you essential knowledge and helpful tips on local electric scooter and e-bike traffic rules and rider safety – all in a fun and engaging way. Boost your road confidence and get rewarded with a free Voi ride! The courses are freely available to all, and in several languages.
