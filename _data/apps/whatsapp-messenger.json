It's super simple, reliable and private, making it perfect for staying in touch with your friends and family worldwide. WhatsApp works across mobile, tablet, and desktop even on slow connections, with no subscription fees*.\n\nPrivate messaging and calls across the world\n\nYour privacy is our priority. With end-to-end encryption, you can be sure that your personal messages and calls stay between you and who you send them to. And no one, not even WhatsApp, can read or listen to them.\n\nSimple and secure connections, right away\n\nAll you need is your phone number - no usernames or logins needed. Easily view your contacts on WhatsApp and start messaging. And what's more, you can easily  link your other devices, including iPads, for seamless connectivity.\n\nHigh quality voice and video calls\n\nEnjoy free, secure video and voice calls with up to 32 people for free. Your calls work across devices, even on slower connections, using your phone or tablet’s Internet service.\n\nGroup chats to keep you in contact\n\nStay close to friends and family through end-to-end encrypted group chats and calls. Share messages, photos, videos and documents across mobile, tablet, and desktop. You can also use call links and screen-sharing to make group calls and collaboration easy.\n\nStay connected in real time\n\nYou can share your location with those in your individual or group chats while using WhatsApp on your mobile phone. Or record a voice message for those moments when just text isn't good enough.\n\nShare daily moments through Status\n\nShare your everyday life with those who matter. With Status you can share text, photos, video, and GIF updates that disappear after 24 hours. You're always in control of who sees your status. Just choose who you want to share it with - all your contacts or selected ones. And bring your everyday to life.\n\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have any feedback or questions, please go to WhatsApp > Settings > Help > Contact Us\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service \n\nLearn more about messaging privately: https://www.whatsapp.com/privacy \n\nLearn more about WhatsApp safety: https://www.whatsapp.com/security","userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":120337,"averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":4.54289,"averageUserRating":4.54289,"trackCensoredName":"WhatsApp Messenger","languageCodesISO2A":["AR","BN","CA","HR","CS","DA","NL","EN","FI","FR","DE","EL","GU","HE","HI","HU","ID","GA","IT","JA","KO","MS","MR","NB","FA","PL","PT","RO","RU","ZH","SK","ES","SV","TH","ZH","TR","UK","UR","VI"],"fileSizeBytes":"251163648","formattedPrice":"Free","contentAdvisoryRating":"12+","trackViewUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/no/app/whatsapp-messenger/id310633997?uo=4","trackContentRating":"12+","sellerUrl":"http://www.whatsapp.com/","currentVersionReleaseDate":"2025-10-27T17:47:45Z","userRatingCount":120337}
