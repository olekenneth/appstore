Countdown and Photo Countdown widgets have been overhauled. As always, you can manually select a date and time for the widget to count down to, but now you can also select an event from your calendar! \n\nYou can now choose from multiple countdown styles. The widget can now display just the number of days until the selected event or use the traditional timer with both days and hours.\n\nAdditionally, you can customize the On This Day widget to hide the date and year so your photos are unobstructed. This widget now accounts for more image types, ensuring more memories surface in the widget over time.\n\nLastly, the Date & Time widget shows the correct date when the selected time zone is a day ahead or behind you.","minimumOsVersion":"14.0","artistId":295660206,"artistName":"Cross Forward Consulting, LLC","genres":["Productivity","Utilities"],"price":0.0,"description":"Widgetsmith lets you personalize your device like never before with a wide range of highly-customizable widgets.
