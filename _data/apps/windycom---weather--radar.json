available, always at the highest possible resolution, to ensure accurate weather forecasts. \n\nWEATHER RADAR & SATELLITE IMAGERY\nA weather radar is the most requested tool for weather forecasting. To provide the most accurate radar imagery, we constantly expand our resources so that rain, snow, and storms don't catch you by surprise. Trusted sources include NOAA, Met Office, AROME, DWD, JMA, ACCESS, and others.\n\nMORE THAN 50 WEATHER MAPS AND TOOLS\n\n- Wind forecast (current speed, gusts, accumulation, models comparison, data from weather stations)\n- Temperature, humidity, pressure, dew point, freezing altitude\n- Rain, thunder, storms, precipitation type, CAPE-index\n- Weather radar and Satellite images (blue, infrared, visible)\n- Clouds, clouds tops, clouds base and visibility (LIFR, IFR, MVFR, VFR), fog\n- Waves, swell, currents\n- Solar activity maps (solar power, UV index, wet-bulb temperature)\n- Snow depth, new snow, snow density\n- NO2, PM 2.5, Aerosol, SO2, Ozone layer, Surface ozone, CO concentration, Dust mass\n- Weather warnings & Extreme forecast \n- Soil moisture, Moisture anomaly, Drought intensity, Fire Danger, Fuel Moisture\n\nAvailable global weather models and resolution: \n- ECMWF\n- GFS by NOAA \n- ICON by DWD \n\nAvailable local weather models\n- HRRR by NOAA\n- NAM by NOAA \n- HRDPS by MSC \n- ICON-EU by DWD\n- ICON-D2 by DWD\n- UKV by British Met Office\n- AROME-HD by Météo France\n- ALADIN by CHMI\n- NEMS by meteoblue\n- MSM by JMA\n- ACCESS-C by Australian BoM\n\n\nCUSTOM WEATHER ALERTS\n- Want to know about essential weather forecasts before everyone else?
