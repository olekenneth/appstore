A car arrives to you to take you wherever you want. You don’t even have to call the driver — just watch your live data in the Yango app from the time you place your order to the time you reach your destination.\n\n• Comfort and coolness\n\nOrder a ride with air conditioning - try the comfort class.\n\n\n• Сash or card\n\nYango conveniently accepts cash or credit card payments. If you add a card to the app, Yango will automatically charge it for completed rides.\n\n\n• An intelligent application\n\nYango not only knows the location and destination of each driver, but builds their routes based on live road conditions. Our special algorithms process this data, connecting you to the Yango driver positioned to reach you first.\n\n\n• It knows where you want to go\n\nYango makes it easy to pick the kids up from school, drop a friend off at a bus stop, and do some quick shopping on the way. Just add a new stop in the app, and Yango will recalculate a new route for the driver.\n\n\n• Multiple destinations, one route.\n\nYango makes it easy to pick the kids up from school, drop a friend off at a bus stop, and do some quick shopping on the way. Just add a new stop in the app, and Yango will recalculate a new route for the driver.\n\n• Order for someone else\n\nYango lets you give a perfect gift to your friends and loved ones: order them a taxi. Get your mother to a doctor’s appointment. Send a taxi to pick up your special someone. Or get each of your friends a ride home after a night out. You may order simultaneously up to 3 cars.\n\n• Chat with the driver in 95 languages\n\nYango makes it easy to communicate with your driver. If you can’t reach your pickup point in time or want to give the driver information without making a phone call, you can use text chat instead. Don’t worry if you and your driver speak different languages — Yango will automatically translate your messages back and forth to each other.\n\n• You make us better\n\nYango is committed to maintaining high quality service. Did something go wrong? Give your ride a low rating and tell us what happened. That driver will get fewer orders until we fix the situation. If everything was great, then reward your driver with a tip.\n\nENJOY YOUR RIDES!\nYango team\n\n\nIf you would like to share your feedback on the app or a specific taxi company, please use the feedback form located at https://yandex.com/support/yango/?lang=en","artistId":308094652,"artistName":"Yandex LLC","genres":["Travel","Navigation"],"price":0.0,"version":"650.9.1","wrapperType":"software","userRatingCount":18}
