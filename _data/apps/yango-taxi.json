Do it all by making a taxi order via the Yango taxi app.\n\nChoose the right service class for you\n\nReach your destination at the right level of comfort and price for you. Choose from several service classes. Start is perfect for short rides. Economy is awesome for when you need a car fast. Comfort lets you sit back and enjoy the ride. And The Fastest offers rides when the service class doesn’t matter… you need the closest available taxi!\n\nRide safely\n\nSafety is our top priority. You’ll see who’s coming to pick you up and in which car right in the app. You’ll see the driver’s name and rating and be able to share your ride with whomever you like so they know where you are.\n\nSmart destinations\n\nYango will suggest destinations for your taxi ride based on your ride history, like first offering ‘home’ as a destination because it’s your most common taxi order on weekday evenings. Ride taxis the smart way!\n\nMultiple destinations, one route\n\nThe Yango taxi app makes everyday life easier. Like picking the kids up from school, dropping a friend off at a market, and doing some quick shopping on the way. Just add a new taxi order stop in the app, and Yango will recalculate a new route for the driver. That makes it even easier to ride a taxi.\n\nOrder for someone else\n\nYango lets you order friends and loved ones a ride by taxi. Get your mother to a doctor’s appointment with a taxi order. Send a taxi online to pick up your special someone. Or get each of your friends a ride home after a night out. You can order up to 3 cars at once.\n\nTell your friends about the Yango taxi app and get discounts\n\nYou can get discounts for your rides by inviting friends to use the Yango taxi app. Share your personal promo code with them and receive bonuses when they take their first ride. Ride taxi, tell friends, save. It’s as easy as that.\n\nAn international service\n\nYango is a ride-hailing service by Yandex.Taxi, an international group of companies that operates mobility and delivery businesses in 19 countries across EMEA under Yandex Go, Yango, and Uber Russia brands.\nEnjoy your ride!\n\nIf you would like to share your feedback on the Yango taxi app or a specific taxi company, please use the feedback form located at yandex.com/support/yango/?lang=en\n\nYango is an informational service and not a transportation or taxi services provider. Transportation services are provided by third parties. The 30% (max 4 GH₵/450 FCFA) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Accra/Douala and Yaoundé until 31.06.2022. The 70% (max 5 EUR/max 100 kr) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Helsinki's city center, Tampere, and Turku/Oslo and Bergen until 31.12.2021.","artistId":308094652,"artistName":"Yandex LLC","genres":["Travel","Navigation"],"price":0.0,"version":"650.21.3","wrapperType":"software","userRatingCount":47}
