Get the whole city in your hands, ride wherever you want, and enjoy comfort at an affordable price. With Yango, everything is possible!\n\nChoose the right service class for you\nReach your destination at the right level of comfort and price for you. Choose from several service classes. Economy is awesome for when you need a ride fast. Comfort lets you sit back and just enjoy the ride. And The Fastest is the best in case when the service class doesn’t matter and you just need the closest ride available!\n\nRide safely\nSafety is our top priority. You’ll see who’s coming to pick you up and in which car right in the app. You’ll see info about the driver, such as their name and rating, and will be able to share your route with whomever you like so they know where you are.\n\nSmart destinations\nYango will suggest destinations for your rides based on your ride history, like first offering ‘home’ as a destination because it’s your most common request on weekday evenings. Ride the smart way!\n\nMultiple destinations, one route\nYango makes everyday life super easy. Like picking the kids up from school, dropping a friend off at a market, and doing some quick shopping on the way. Just add a new stop in the app, and Yango will recalculate a new route for the driver. \n\nRequest rides for close ones\nShow you care by requesting rides for friends and relatives. Get your mother to a doctor’s appointment, book a ride to pick up your special someone, or get each of your friends a ride home after a night out. You can request up to 3 cars at once.\n\nRefer friends and get discounts\nInvite friends to try Yango and save together. Share your personal promo code, get a discount on your next ride and grant your friend with an extra discount on their first ride. It’s as easy as that.\n\nMeet Delivery - it's like a taxi service, but for your packages\n\nWe've also built in a fast delivery service into Yango - use Delivery to quickly send personal packages or even business orders by courier anywhere in the city. Delivery is suitable for any item that can be transported by scooter or car. \n\nAn international service\nYango is a ride-hailing, mobility, and delivery aggregator service that operates in more than 20 countries around the world, including Norway, Finland, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Zambia.\n\nYango is an informational service and not a transportation or taxi services provider. Transportation services are provided by third parties.\nThe size and duration of the discount for the first rides requested via the Yango app vary depending on the country and city. Open the app for specific details.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://yango.com/legal/yango_privacy_notice\nYango Plus subscription conditions:\nhttps://deli.yango.com/en-IL/about/docs/legal/yango_plus_conditions","userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":6510,"trackCensoredName":"Yango: taxi, food, delivery","trackViewUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/no/app/yango-taxi-food-delivery/id1437157286?uo=4","contentAdvisoryRating":"4+","averageUserRating":4.84593,"minimumOsVersion":"15.0","trackName":"Yango: taxi, food, delivery","trackId":1437157286,"userRatingCount":6510}
