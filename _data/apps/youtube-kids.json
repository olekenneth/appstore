for children\nYouTube Kids was created to give children a more contained environment that makes it simpler and more fun for them to explore on their own, and easier for parents and caregivers to guide their journey as they discover new and exciting interests along the way.\n\nA safer online experience for children\nWe work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online.  But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through, so we're constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.\n\nCustomise your child's experience with Parental Controls\nLimit screen time: Set a time limit for how long your children can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.\nKeep up with what they watch: Simply check the 'watch it again' page and you'll always know what they've watched and the newest interests that they're exploring.\nBlocking: Don't like a video? Block the video or whole channel and never see it again.\nFlagging: You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nCreate individual experiences as unique as your children\nCreate up to eight child profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations and settings. Choose from 'Approved Content Only' mode or select an age category that fits your child: 'Preschool', 'Younger' or 'Older'.\n\nSelect the 'Approved Content Only' mode if you want to hand-pick the videos, channels and/or collections that you've approved your child to watch. In this mode, children won't be able to search for videos.The 'Preschool' Mode curates videos that promote creativity, playfulness, learning and exploration. The 'Younger' Mode allows children aged 5â€“8 to explore their interests in a wide variety of topics including songs, cartoons and crafts. While our 'Older' Mode gives children aged 9 and up the chance to search and explore additional content such as popular music and gaming videos for children.\n\nAll kinds of videos for all kinds of children\nOur library is filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your children's inner creativity and playfulness. It's everything from their favourite shows and music to learning how to build a model volcano (or make slime ;-), and everything in between.\n\nOther important information:\nParental setup is required to ensure the best experience possible for your child.\nYour child may also see videos from YouTube creators with commercial content in them that are not paid ads.The Privacy Notice for Google Accounts managed with Family Link describes our privacy practices when your child uses YouTube Kids with their Google Account. When your child uses YouTube Kids without signing into their Google Account, the YouTube Kids Privacy Notice applies.","trackCensoredName":"YouTube Kids","trackViewUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/no/app/youtube-kids/id936971630?uo=4","contentAdvisoryRating":"4+","averageUserRating":4.50884,"genres":["Entertainment","Education"],"artistId":281956209,"artistName":"Google","userRatingCount":17823}
